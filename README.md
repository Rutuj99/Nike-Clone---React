## Hosting and API
- The website's data is hosted on the Render website to generate the API and fetch data to display on the website. This ensures that the website loads quickly and securely. The Requres API is used to authenticate users and ensure secure login credentials and deployed on Netlify. These technologies work together to create a seamless and secure online shopping experience for users.

## Future Scope

- In the future, we plan to add more features to our Nike clone, such as a product recommendation system, customer reviews, more products and a more advanced search functionality. We also plan to improve the performance and responsiveness of the website.

## Conclusion

- Overall, our first React js  project in Masai School's Full-Stack Web Development program was a challenging and rewarding experience. We gained valuable experience in web development and worked as a team to create a fully functional website. We are excited to continue learning and building new projects in the future.
